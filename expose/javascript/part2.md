1. `3` printed; created a variable `i` in the loop that terminates at value 3.
2. `150` printed; variable's last assignment is `300 * (1 - 0.5)`
3. `150` printed; variable's last assignment was `Math.round(150 * 100) / 100`
4. Returns `[50, 100, 150]` because function pushes the discounted prices to the array and then returns it.
5. "ReferenceError: i is not defined" because variable `i` was declared inside loop
6. "ReferenceError: discountedPrices is not defined" because variable `doscountedPrice` was declared inside loop
7. `150` printed; variable's last assignment was `Math.round(150 * 100) / 100`
8. Function returns `[50, 100, 150]` because the function pushes the discounted prices to the array, then returns it
9. "ReferenceError: i is not defined"; variable `i` declared in scope of the loop
10. `3` will be printed; length of prices array
11. Function returns `[50, 100, 150]` because the function pushes the discounted prices to the array, then returns it
12. 
    A. `student.name`  
    B. `student['Grad Year']`  
    C. `student.greeting()`  
    D. `student['Favorite Teacher'].name`  
    E. `student.courseLoad[0]`  

13.  
    A. `32` as number gets converted to string before addition
    B. `1`  as string gets converted to the number before subtraction
    C. `3` as null gets converted to a number before addition
    D. `3null` as null gets converted to string
    E. `4` as true gets converted to 1 before addition
    F. `0` as both false and null become numbers; both 0
    G. `3undefined` as undefined is converted to string
    H. `NaN` as the string of 3 becomes a number and subtracting undefined from a number results in a NaN
  
14. 
    A. `true` as 2 gets converted to number and is more than 1  
    B. `false` as the dictionary order does not result in true  
    C. `true` as string gets converted to number 
    D. `false` as they are not the same type as required by ==  
    E. `false` true does not result in 2 when converted  
    F. `true` as Boolean function results in 2 being true

15. `===` (strict equality operator) is equality without type conversions, `==` (equality operator) is equality with possible type conversions
17. `[2, 4, 6]`. `modifyArray` is called with `[1,2,3]` and each value is doubled using `doSomething`
19. `1`, `4`, `3`, `2`
